What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
- In this course, the problem I was solving was how to design and implement an advising assistance program that could efficiently
store, sort, and retrieve course information. The program needed to read course data from a file, display all courses in alphanumeric
order, and allow users to look up a specific course and its prerequisites. A major part of the challenge was selecting the most appropriate
data structure to support the requirements, and planning in advance the strategy I would use to complete this. The project required both planning
and implementation to create a functional and well-structured application.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
- I approached the problem by first analyzing the program's requirements and then evaluating different data structures based on their performance
and efficiency. Understanding data structures was essential to this class because each one affects sorting, searching, and memory usage
differently. By performing a Big O analysis, I was able to compare their runtime behavior and determine which structure best me the program's
needs. This helped to ensure the final implementation would be bost efficient and scalable.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
- One of the main challenges I had was translating the pseudocode into working code, especially when handling the file input and managing course
prerequisites. I overcame this by breaking the program into smaller sections and testing each part individually. I debugged and reviewed the
compiler's feedback to help me correct logic and syntax errors I had. Taking a step by step approach made the project overall more manageable.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
- This project reinforced the importance of planning before coding. Designing the pseudocode and analyzing the data structures first made the coding
phase much more efficient and organized for me. It also helped me think more critically about performance and scalability instead of just focusing
on making the program function. I will now approach development with a stringer emphasiss on structure and long-term effiency after these projects.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
- This project improved my ability to write organized and modular code by separating functionality into clear, manageable sections. I focused more
on meaningful variable names and appropriate inline comments to improve readability. I also learned to design programs in a a way that allows for
future expansion or modification. Overall, these projects have helped me to write code with maintainability and clarity as main priorities.
